# VITA

VITA is an interactive mobile application for Alzheimer patients. The
most recent World Alzheimer Report reveals an increasing trend in the
statistics of people suffering from dementia in its various forms. We
seek to help through a range of solutions for patients to support them
and boost their self value. Our organised solution approach involves
understanding the different perspectives a patient can come from.

-   People Tab allows users to search for familiar places and help
    recognise pictures of loved ones. A single click on the bouncy,
    visible, uncomplicated `Identify` button will render results.
-   Event Tab allows users to keep a track of their schedules. They can
    go ahead of a calendar and write down everyday chores and simple

    which contains primary details of users.
