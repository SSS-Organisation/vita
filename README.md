# VITA

VITA is an interactive mobile application for Alzheimer patients. The most recent World Alzheimer Report reveals an increasing trend in the statistics of people suffering from dementia in its various forms. There is no existence of a system to help patients suffering from Alzheimer's to keep track of their regular activities, recognize their loved ones and for prevention of repetitive behaviour.
